## Consolidation 

This week and over half term I'd like you to concentrate on reviewing and consolidating the C# we've covered this term: 

 - the structure of a Visual Studio solution 
 - functions, including return values and passing by reference and by value 
 - testing, including using expected values 
 - formatting strings for output 
 - loops - for, while and do-while 
 - type conversion - inc. casting and parsing

## Finding problems 

There are various places to find ideas of things to do: 

 - [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com/r/_8bpdw) - sample questions with the chance to review others' responses when you've answered a question (follow the link for a 'clan' invitation).
 - [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1) - lots of bespoke problems, although not easy to find answers if you're stuck (perhaps practice on 2016)
 - [Old BIO (Computing Olympiad) problems](https://olympiad.org.uk/problems.html):  
   - Q1 - fairly approachable 
   - Q2 - lots of setup 
   - Q3 - looking to circumvent brute force 
  - [USACO](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=contests) are similar - the bronze problems are generally quite approachable, an advantage here is that it will verify your answers

## Half Term

So create a suitable folder (or several) in your repo and work on the problems, e.g. `/usaco/` or `/aoc/` etc. and go solve some problems. 

Commit-and-push regularly!
