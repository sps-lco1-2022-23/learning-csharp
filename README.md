# learning-csharp

This repo will contains assignments, how-to documents, code snippets and anything else I think you might need. 

You can clone this repo or just refer to the documents via the web interface. 

You are all members of the `2023-students` team which itself is part of this `sps-lco1-2022-23` organisation. 

## Your Repo

Within this organisation you will have your own repo with the name `lastname_firstname`. 

You should clone this repo to your own machine, you should then create all new C# solutions in that space (feel free to copy across existing solution hierarchies). 

I retain admin rights to your repo (it is just easier that way), but you will get write access to your own repo. 

## Assignments 

To an extent, we will work things out as we go. I want us to try and use _issues_ and _pull requests_ to manage the flow, but we can play that by ear. 

Generally when you do work, you should commit (which saves a local copy to 'staging'). Then when you're ready, you should push or sync, this copies to the server where I can see it. 

If you open an 'issue' you can tag me, so I get notified. I can mark it and close it. I might even raise a 'pull request` to suggest changes.
